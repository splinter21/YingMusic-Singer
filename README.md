## Overview ✨

**YingMusic-Singer** is a unified framework for **Zero-shot Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) and Editing**, driven by **Annotation-free Melody Guidance**. Addressing the scalability challenges of real-world applications, our system eliminates the reliance on costly phoneme-level alignment and manual melody annotations. It enables **arbitrary lyrics to be synthesized or edited with any reference melody** in a zero-shot manner.

Our approach leverages a **Diffusion Transformer (DiT)** based generative model, incorporating a pre-trained melody extraction module to derive MIDI information directly from reference audio. By introducing a structured guidance mechanism and employing **Flow-GRPO reinforcement learning**, we achieve superior pronunciation clarity, melodic accuracy, and musicality without requiring fine-grained alignment.

### 🔧 Key Features

- **Unified Synthesis & Editing**: Supports both zero-shot singing voice synthesis and precise singing voice editing within a single framework.
- **Annotation-free Melody Guidance**: Derives melody directly from reference audio, removing the need for manual MIDI or phoneme-level annotations.
- **Zero-Shot Capabilities**: Synthesize or edit high-quality singing voices from arbitrary lyrics and reference melodies without training on the target voice.
- **Flow-GRPO Reinforcement Learning**: Optimizes pronunciation, melodic accuracy, and musicality via multi-objective rewards.
  <!-- - **Structured Guidance Mechanism**: Enhances melodic stability and coherence using similarity distribution constraints. -->
  <!-- - **Robust Generalization**: Outperforms existing methods in zero-shot synthesis and lyric replacement scenarios. -->

## Quick Start 🚀

Download model checkpoints from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/GiantAILab/YingMusic-Singer)

### 1. Singing Voice Synthesis

```bash
# Please keep the prompt audio duration is around 5-7 seconds, and the total duration does not exceed 30 seconds.
python src/singer/model.py --ckpt_path "ckpt_path" \
    --timbre_audio_path "resources/audios/0000.wav" \
    --timbre_audio_content "在爱的回归线 又期待相见" \
    --melody_audio_path "resources/audios/mxsf.wav" \
    --lyrics "你说 你爱了不该爱的人 你的心中满是伤痕" \
    --out_path "test_yingsinger_zs.wav" \
    --cfg_strength 3.0 \
    --nfe_steps 100
```

### 2. Singing Voice Editing

```bash
# Please keep the prompt audio duration is around 5-7 seconds, and the total duration does not exceed 30 seconds.
python src/singer/model.py --ckpt_path "ckpt_path" \
    --timbre_audio_path "resources/audios/mxsf.wav" \
    --timbre_audio_content "你说 你爱了不该爱的人 你的心中满是伤痕" \
    --melody_audio_path "resources/audios/mxsf.wav" \
    --lyrics "你说 你演错了剧本 赔尽了天真心真" \
    --out_path "outputs/test_yingsinger.wav" \
    --cfg_strength 3.0 \
    --nfe_steps 100
```
